    /*
    John places domino tiles vertically, close to each other, so that he can easily distinguish the upper and lower parts of each tile. Then he picks number K. Now, he has to find the minimal number of rotations (upside down) needed to obtain a sum of at least K dots in all upper panels.

Write a function that, given two arrays (A and B) and a number K, where A and B each containing N integers, denoting the counts of the dots on both ends of the N domino tiles (A[0] and B[0] describe the first domino tile, A[1] and B[1] describe the second domino tile, etc.), returns the minimal number of rotations needed to obtain a sum of at least K dots in A. If it is not possible to obtain a sum of at least K, your function should return âˆ’1.

For example, given: A = [2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1], B = [3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 4] and K = 19 your function should return 3 because you can rotate the first, fourth and sixth tiles, so that A will be equal to [3, 3, 1, 6, 2, 4] and the sum of its elements is 19.
